# we will create the staircase out of a series of rectangles that get increasingly tall
# so this variable will control the height of each rectangle, starting at the height of the first step
myHeight = myStepHeight

myX = 0

# make a new page
newPage()

# set the fill color to green

# make a background, which is a rectangle that starts at (0, 0) and covers the whole page
rect(0, 0, width(), height())

# set the color to magenta

# now letâ€™s do a loop through the range of numbers between 0 and myStepCount, creating the myRect variable to represent the number we are on

    # draw a rectangle
    rect(myX, 0, myWidth, myHeight)
    # augment the X value so that the next rectangle is drawn to the right
    myX += myWidth
    # also augment myHeight value, so the next rectangle will be taller
    myHeight += myStepHeight
